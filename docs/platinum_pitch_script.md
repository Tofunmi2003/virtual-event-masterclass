# Day 3 Platinum Pitch Script: "The Expansion"
**Context:** This script is designed to be delivered at the 45-minute mark of Day 3.

**(Transition from content to the "Gap")**

"Over the last 3 days, I’ve given you the framework.
You know the Foundation (Day 1).
You know the Offer Structure (Day 2).
And today, we talked about Scaling (Day 3).

But here is the reality..."
*(Pause for effect)*

"Knowing the system is different from **building** the system.
Right now, you have two choices.

**Choice 1:** You take these notes, you go back into your busy life, and you try to piece this together alone. You struggle with the tech. You second-guess your offer. And maybe, in 6 months, you launch one event.

**Choice 2:** You decide that you want this **done**."

**(The Introduction of the Offer)**

"I didn't want to just leave you with information. I wanted to give you the implementation.
That is why I created the **Platinum Implementation Bundle**."

"This isn't just a course. It's a shortcuts package."

**Here is what you get:**
1.  **The Full Event Monetization Blueprint**: My internal SOPs, checklists, and run-of-show templates. You literally just fill in the blanks.
2.  **The Tech Vault**: I show you exactly how to set up Systeme.io, Zoom, and Stripe so they talk to each other perfectly.
3.  **The 'Golden' Offer Review**: You will get a dedicated session where we look at your specific offer and refine it to ensure it converts."

**(The Close / Pricing)**

"My private clients pay $5,000 for me to consult on their events.
But because you are here, and you’ve invested 3 days with me, I want to make this a no-brainer.

You can get the entire **Platinum Implementation Bundle** for just **$199**.

That is less than the price of one ticket you will sell at your future event.
Sell ONE ticket, and this system pays for itself."

**(Call to Action)**

"Click the button below. Join Platinum.
Let’s stop 'planning' to do an event and actually build the revenue engine this week.

Spot secure yours now."
